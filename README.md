# Genetic Algorithm

## Objective: 
Exploratory program to create GA code and test it by pathfinding through a dictionary-based graph.
    
## Requires:
- the number of genes in each chromosome 
- the number of generations to run
- the number of chromosomes in a population per generation
- the evaluation function, which should be designed to take the list of genes as input
- and the desired gene value range; defaulted to (-100,100)
    
## Applications:
So far this GA has been used to find solutions to equations and in finding optimal paths through graphs.
